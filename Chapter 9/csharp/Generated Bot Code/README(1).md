# QnA Maker

Bot Framework v4 QnA Maker bot sample. This sample shows how to integrate Multiturn and Active learning in a QnA Maker bot with ASP.Net Core-2. Click [here][72] to know more about using follow-up prompts to create multiturn conversation. To know more about how to enable and use active learning, click [here][71].

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to create a bot that uses the [QnA Maker Cognitive AI](https://www.qnamaker.ai) service.

The [QnA Maker Service](https://www.qnamaker.ai) enables you to build, train and publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured documents or editorial content in minutes. In this sample, we demonstrate how to use the QnA Maker service to answer questions based on a FAQ text file used as input.

## Concepts introduced in this sample
The [QnA Maker Service][7] enables you to build, train and publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured documents or editorial content in minutes.
In this sample, we demonstrate how to use the Active Learning to generate suggestions for knowledge base.
